angelcore brazilian phonk — bright, ethereal, heavenly vibe with smooth 808 bass and soft brazilian percussion.
shimmering synths, crystal bells, gentle cowbells and dreamy reverb.
airy female vocals with angelic harmonies, light choirs and glowing pads.
golden sunlight, floating feeling, divine energy over the rhythm.
emotional, celestial, peaceful yet groovy.
style angelcore, brazilian phonk, dreamy electronic, ambient groove.
